# Keypad Interfacing with Arduino

This repository explores the interfacing of 4x4 keypad with an Arduino, but without using any built-in headers. The goal is to completely learn the interfacing mechanism from scratch. 

The code is implemeted using State Machines for better modularity and code efficiency. The code is divided into different modules, each containing a header file and a code file.

The .sim1 file is the [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p/) simulation of the whole code. The firmware folder contains the compiled binaries (HEX and ELF) for direct uploading into Arduino Uno.
